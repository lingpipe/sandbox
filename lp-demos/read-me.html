<h2>Case Restoration as Spelling Correction</h2>

<p>The general noisy channel model underlying our spell checker has
been applied to several tasks other than spelling.  Most notably for
text processing is perhaps case restoration, which we consider in this
section.  A related capability is space insertion, which we cover in
the <a href="../chineseTokens/read-me.html">chinese word segmentation
tutorial</a> tutorial in detail; also, our general spell checker
described above will insert or delete spaces as a matter of spell
checking.</p>

<h3>Custom Weighted Edit Distance</h3>

<p>The only difference between case restoration and general spelling
correction is the choice of weighted edit distance function.  For case
restoration, we simply allow any character to be replaced with an
upper or lower case version of itself.  In the general case of case
editing, we may assign a cost to this edit.  In the full case
inference problem from single case text, we will typically make this
edit cost free.
</p>

<h3>Training on a Large Corpus</h3>

<p> For convenience, we train a spelling corrector here on the <a
href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2003T05">LDC
English Gigaword corpus</a>.  In general, one should train on a corpus
that is both high quality in terms of editing and close to the desired
run-time data.
</p>

<p>The training code, <a
href="src/GigawordTrainer.java"><code>src/GigawordTrainer.java</code></a>
is boilerplate.  It simply uses LingPipe's Gigaword text parser to
feed text to the spelling trainer.  The command takes several parameters,
as can be seen by looking at the Ant target <code>trainGigaword</code>
in <a href="build.xml"><code>build.xml</code></a>.
