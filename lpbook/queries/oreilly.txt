"Text Processing in Java" focusses on the core Java classes and
technologies needed to process natural language text data.
As the amount of both public domain and proprietary unstructured text data
increases, so do the opportunities for novel text-mining applications.
This book is aimed at Java programmers involved in this enterprise,
whether they are looking to take deep text processing to the next
level or just trying to eliminate mojibake (character problems).

This book covers the nitty gritty details of bytes, characters, strings, 
code points, Unicode and legacy character encodings.
It presents appropriate classes and methods from the java.io and java.nio packages
needed to safely, correctly, and efficiently transform character data
to bytes and back again.
Understanding these details is key to using Java's
Localization/Internationalization features.
It also covers normalization of character data using the ICU 
(International Components for Unicode) normalization package.
Normalizing character encodings is necessary for
sorting and indexing and data deduplication.
The chapter on regular expressions provides a comprehensive overview
of the  syntax and use of regular expressions,
including character classes, operator scope and precedence, quantification,
grouping and references,  lookahead and lookbehind.
Complex regular expressions can be used to create powerful
ad-hoc parsers to munge text data from one format to another.
Of particular importance is character data sent via HTTP.
The chapter on character data and the web covers encodings and how
to properly parse and generate character data for XML, HTML, and JSON.
Finally, it covers use of Lucene and Solr, two extremely powerful and
widely used applications for search and indexing.

This book compliments existing books on Java programming because
its focus is always on processing character data.  It pulls together
information that is scattered across javadocs, blog posts, and threads on
StackOverflow but strips out distracting, problem specific details.
Among the O'Reilly books that it complements are:
XML and Java
Java Servlets
Localization/Internationalization
Mastering Regular Expressions.
