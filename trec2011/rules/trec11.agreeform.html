	<P>The annual Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) is an event in which 
	organizations with an interest in information retrieval and related 
	technologies take part in a coordinated series of experiments using the same 
	experimental data and queries.  The results of these individual experiments 
	are then presented at a workshop where tentative comparisons may be made.  
	In order to preserve the desired, pre-competitive nature of these conferences, 
	the organizers have developed a set of guidelines constraining the 
	dissemination and publication of TREC evaluation results.  These guidelines 
	are meant to preclude the publication of incomplete or inaccurate information 
	that could damage the reputation of the conference or its participants and 
	could discourage participation in future conferences.  The guidelines apply
	to all TREC participants and to organizations requesting access to the archive
	of TREC results.</P>

	<P>A signed agreement is required of each organization participating in
	the TREC evaluations or accessing the results archive.  Any organization
	that is found to have violated the terms or spirit of the agreement may be
	denied participation in future TRECs. </P>

	<B>GUIDELINES: </B> <BR>
	<OL>
	<LI><B>SCIENTIFIC OR TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS: </B> Scientific or technical
	publications, including newsletters from universities or research
	laboratories, should adhere to community standards for fairness and
	objectivity and should accurately and clearly state the limitations of
	the testing conditions and other factors which might influence scores.
	The experimental nature of the tasks, data and evaluation procedures
	should also be stated.  The full conference proceedings should always
	be referenced.

	<LI><B>ADVERTISEMENTS: </B>No advertisements using the TREC evaluation results
	can be placed in magazines, journals, newspapers, or other publications.

	<LI><B>PRESS RELEASES:  </B> Press releases about TREC results to organizations 
	with national/international coverage are also prohibited.

	<LI><B>MARKETING LITERATURE, LOCAL NEWSLETTERS: </B>Although it is recognized 
	that extensive evaluation discussions are not appropriate in this type
	of literature, it is expected that any claims made on the basis of 
	evaluation results are accurate, that the evaluation measures used to 
	substantiate these claims are stated, and that a reference is made to 
	the full conference proceedings.  Where promotional material is subject 
	to prepublication revision by the media, the author should make every 
	effort to see that the revision does not cause a violation of the guidelines.

	<LI>Web Sites: Web sites are a type of marketing literature with a global
	distribution. The guidelines for marketing literature in general apply to web sites
	as well. References to TREC should link to the TREC web site.	
	
	<LI>Cross-system comparisons may not be made with other named teams for
	individual tests, and may only be made when they are supported by
	accepted methods of statistical significance testing. Comparisons must be
	accompanied by the results of those tests and should reference the
	publication of those tests in the conference proceedings or related
	literature. Informal, qualitative comparisons with recognized
	baselines or benchmarks, and with general levels or trends in performance,
	must be clearly stated to be such and thus open to statistical reassessment.

	<LI>A copy of any publication that quotes or contains references to
	the TREC evaluation results must be provided to the TREC program chair.
