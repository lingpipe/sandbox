Aramorph.jar for Arabic morphology demo.  Frustratingly non thread
safe.  Have to add a word then retrieve the analyses as a "solution"
then pull out the lemma -- also ambiguous.  Analyzer, not 1.0-b is
the later one. GNU license with unpacked full download from sourceforge:

Use ICU to normalize and then strip off diacritics for another
useful tokenizer.
