\mychapter{Getting Started}{GETTING STARTED}

\firstchar{T}he purpose of this book is to provide a
hands-on introduction to the use of the LingPipe
natural language processing library for building natural
language processing components and applications.  

\noindent Before beginning with a hello world example that will verify
that everything's in place, we'll take some time to explain the tools
we'll be using or that you might want to use.  All of these tools are
open source and freely available.  After describing and motivating our
choice of each tool, we'll provide downloading and installation
instructions.

\mysection{Unix Shell Tools}

\noindent We present examples as run from the shell through the Ant
build environment or directly.  One reason to use shells or a build
environment is that it's easy to script operations so that they may be
repeated.

The main problem with scripts is that they are not portable across
operating systems or even types of command-line shells.
We use Unix-style commands, which should
be familiar to anyone working in a Unix, Linux, or Mac OS X environment.

\mysubsection{Cygwin for Windows}

\noindent
If you're working in Windows (XP, Vista or 7), we recommend the 
Cygwin suite of Unix command-line tools for Windows.  They may be
downloaded and installed through Cygwin's home page,

\begin{quote}
\hrefurl{http://www.cygwin.com/}
\end{quote}

The {\tt setup.exe} program is small.  When you run it, it goes out
over the internet to find the packages from registered mirrors.  It
then lists all the packages available.  You can install some or all of
them.  We  Just
run the setup program again 

\mysubsection{Archive and Compression Tools}

\noindent
We will assume you can run {\tt tar} archiving tool, as well as the
unpacking commands {\tt unzip} and {\tt gunizp}.  These may be
installed as part of Cygwin on Windows.


\mysection{Version Control}

\noindent
If you don't live in some kind of version control environment, you should.
Not only can you keep track of your own code across multiple sites and/or
users, you can also keep up to date with all the LingPipe releases and
code from free online version control repositories such as SourceForge.  

We prefer the shell for all of our work, and you can install a
shell-based version of Subversion, the command-name for which is {\tt
svn}.  SVN itself requires a secure shell (SSH) client over which to
run.  These may both be installed through Cygwin for Windows users.


\mysection{Text Editors}

\noindent
In order to generate code, HTML, and reports, you will need to be able
to edit text.  We like to work in the emacs text editor, because of
its configurability.  It's as close as you'll get to an IDE in a
simple text editor.  We use the XEmacs distribution of emacs, which is
available from its home page,

\begin{quote}
\hrefurl{http://www.xemacs.org/}
\end{quote}

There's an installer for Windows.  We found the install from {\tt
xemacs.org} to work better than the one that comes with Cygwin as far
as interacting with Windows.  We like to work with the Lucida Console
font, which is distributed with Windows; it's the font used for examples
in this textbook.

\mysubsection{Spaces, Not Tabs}

\noindent
To make code portable, we highly recommend using spaces instead of
tabs.  Yes, it takes up a bit more space, but it's worth it.
Here's the command to put in your configuration file (get there
by selecting the {\tt Edit Init File} selection from the {\tt Options}
menu in XEmacs, then save using the {\tt Save Options to Custom File}
selecting from the {\tt Options} menu.

\begin{verbatim}
(defun java-mode-untabify ()
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (if (search-forward "t" nil t)
        (untabify (1- (point)) (point-max))))
  nil)

(add-hook 'java-mode-hook
          '(lambda ()
             (make-local-variable 'write-contents-hooks)
             (add-hook 'write-contents-hooks 'java-mode-untabify)))

(setq indent-tabs-mode nil)
\end{verbatim}


\mysection{Java Standard Edition 6}

\noindent We chose Java as the basis for LingPipe because we felt it
provided the best tradeoff among efficiency, usability, portability,
and library availability.  

The presentation here assumes the reader has a basic working knowledge
of the Java programming language.  We will focus on a few aspects of
Java that are particularly crucial for processing textual language
data, such as character and string representations, input and output
streams and character encodings, regular expressions, parsing HTML and
XML markup, etc.  In explaining LingPipe's design, we will also delve
into greater detail on general features of Java such as concurrency,
generics, floating point representations, and the collection package.

This book is based on the latest currently supported standard edition
of the Java platform (Java SE), which is version 6.  You will need the
Java development kit (JDK) in order to compile Java programs.  A java
virtual machine (JVM) is required to execute compiled Java programs.
A Java runtime environment (JRE) contains platform-specific support
and integration for a JVM and often interfaces to web browsers for
applet support.

Java is available in 32-bit and 64-bit versions.  The 64-bit version
is required to allocate JVMs with heaps larger than 1.5 or 2 gigabytes
(the exact maximum for 32-bit Java depends on the platform).

Java is updated regularly and it's worth having the latest version.
Updates include bug fixes and often include performance enhancements,
some of which can be quite substantial.

Java must be installed on the operating system so that shell commands
will execute it.  We have to manage multiple versions of Java, so
typically we will define an environment variable {\tt JAVA\_HOME}, and
add {\tt \$\{JAVA\_HOME\}/bin} (Unix) or {\tt \%JAVA\_HOME\%{\textbackslash}bin} (Windows) 
to the {\tt PATH}.  We then set {\tt JAVA\_HOME} to either {\tt
JAVA\_1\_5}, {\tt JAVA\_1\_6}, or {\tt JAVA\_1\_7} depending on use
case.  Note that {\tt JAVA\_HOME} is one level above Java's {\tt bin}
directory containing the executable Java commands.

You can test this with the following command, which
should produce similar results.

\begin{quote}
{\small
\ttfamily
{\it\ttfamily > java -version}
\\
java version "1.6.0\_18"
\\
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0\_18-b07)
\\
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 16.0-b13, mixed mode)
}
\end{quote}



\mysection{Ant}

\noindent We present examples for compilation and for running programs
using the Apache Ant build tool.  Ant has three key features that make
it well suited for expository purposes.  First, it's portable across
all the platforms that support Java.  Second, it provides clear XML
representations for core Java concepts such as classpaths and
command-line arguments.  Third, invoking a target in Ant directly
executes the dependent targets and then all of the commands in the
target.  Thus we find Ant builds easier to follow than those using the
classic build tool Make or its modern incarnation Apache Maven, both
of which attempt to resolve dependencies among targets and determine
if targets are up to date before executing them.

Although we're not attempting to teach Ant, we'll walk through a basic
Ant build file in this introduction to give you a reading knowledge of
Ant.  If you're using an IDE like Eclipse or NetBeans, you can import
Ant build files directly to create a project.

Ant is is an Apache project, and as such, is subject to the Apache license,
\begin{quote}
\hrefurl{http://ant.apache.org/license.html}
\end{quote}
%
Ant is available from 
%
\begin{quote}
\hrefurl{http://ant.apache.org/}
\end{quote}
%
You only need one of the binary distributions, which will
look like {\ttfamily apache-ant-{\it\ttfamily version}-bin.tar.gz}.

First, you need to unpack the distribution.  We like directory
structures with release names, which is how ant unpacks, using
top-level directory names like {\tt apache-ant-1.8.1}.  Then, you need
to put the {\tt bin} subdirectory of the top-level directory into the
{\tt PATH} environment variable so that Ant may be executed from the
command line.

Ant requires the {\tt JAVA\_HOME} environment variable to be set to
the path above the {\tt bin} directory containing the Java
executables.  

Ant's installation instructions suggest setting the {\tt
ANT\_HOME} directory in the same way, and then adding but it's not necessary unless
you will be scripting calls to Ant.

Ant build files may be imported directly into the Eclipse IDE.


\mysection{Integrated Development Environment}

\noindent
Many pepeople prefer to write (and compile and debug) code in an
integrated development environment (IDE).  IDE's offer advantages such
as automatic command completion, easily configurable text formatting,
stepwise debuggers, and automated tools for code generation and
refactoring.  

LingPipe development may be carried out through an IDE.  The two most
popular IDEs for Java are Eclipse and NetBeans.

\mysubsection{Eclipse Development Environment}

\noindent
Eclipse provides a full range of code checking (lint), auto-completion
and code generation, and debugging facilities.  Eclipse is an open source
project, and a wide range of additional tools are available as plugins.  It
also has modules for languages other than Java, such as C++ and PHP.

The full set of Eclipse downloads is listed on the following page,
%
\begin{quote}
\hrefurl{http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/}
\end{quote}

You'll want to make sure you choose the one compatible with the JDK
you are using.  It's mainly designed to work on Windows, but has been
ported to Linux and Mac OS X (though Carbon).


\mysubsection{NetBeans}

\noindent
Unlike Eclipse, the NetBeans IDE is written entirely in Java.  Thus
it's possible to run it under Windows, Linux, Solaris Unix, and Mac OS
X. There is also a wide range of plug-ins available for NetBeans.

You can get NetBeans for free from its home page,

\mysection{LingPipe}

\noindent
LingPipe is distributed under both commercial licenses
and under a royalty-free license.  A copy of the royalty free
license is available at:
%
\begin{quote}
\hrefurl{http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/licenses/lingpipe-license-1.txt}
\end{quote}

LingPipe may be downloaded with full source from its web site:
%
\begin{quote}
\hrefurl{http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/}
\end{quote}
%
Other than unpacking, the gzipped tarball, there is nothing required
for installation.  Downloading LingPipe is not technically necessary for
running the examples in this book because the LingPipe library jar is
included with the book's source download.


\mysection{Book Source and Libraries}

\noindent
The code samples from this book are available via anonymous subversion checkout
from the LingPipe sandbox.  Specifically, the entire content of the book,
including code and text, may be checked out anonymously using,

\begin{quote}
{\small\ttfamily
> svn co https://aliasi.devguard.com/svn/sandbox/lpbook
}
\end{quote}
%
The distribution contains all of the code and Ant build files for
running it.  It also contains the \LaTeX\ source for the book itself
as well as the system to extract text from the source for automatic
inclusion in the book.
