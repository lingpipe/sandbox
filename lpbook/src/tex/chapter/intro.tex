\mychapter{Introduction}{INTRODUCTION}

\firstchar{L}ingPipe is an interconnected suite of natural language
processing libraries implemented in Java.  This book explains the
tools that are available in LingPipe and provides examples of how they
may be used to build natural language processing (NLP) applications.

LingPipe's application programming interface (API) is tailored to
abstract over low-level implementation details to enable components
such as tokenizers or classifiers to be swapped in a plug-and-play
fashion.  LingPipe contains a mixture of heuristic rule-based components and
statistical components, often implementing the same interfaces, as for
statistical phrase chunkers and regular-expression-based chunkers.

The presentation here will be hands on and assume the reader is
comfortable reading short and relatively simple Java programs.  In
some cases, programming idioms like loop boundaries being
inclusive/exclusive and higher-level design patterns like visitors
will also be presupposed.  More specific aspects of Java coding
relating to text processing, such as streaming I/O, character
decoding, string representations, and regular expression processing
will be discussed in more depth.  We will also go into some detail on
collections, XML/HTML parsing with SAX, and serialization patterns.

We do not presuppose any knowledge of linguistics beyond a simple
understanding of the terms used in dictionaries such as words,
syllables, pronunciations, and parts of speech such as noun and
preposition.  We will spend considerable time introducing linguistic
concepts, such as word senses or noun phrase chunks, as they relate to
natural language processing modules in LingPipe.

We will do our best to first introduce LingPipe's modules and their
application from a hands-on practical API perspective rather than a
theoretical one.  In most cases, such as for logistic regression
classifiers and conditional random field (CRF) taggers and chunkers,
it's possible learn how to effectively fit complex and useful models
without fully understanding the mathematical basis of LingPipe's
estimation and optimization algorithms.  In other cases, such as naive
Bayes classifiers, hierarchical clusterers and hidden Markov models
(HMM), there is almost no hand-tuning required.

Deeper understanding of LingPipe's algorithms and statistical models
requires familiarity with computational complexity analysis and basic
probability theory including information theory.  

After introducing LingPipe's modules and their applications at a
programming level, we will provide mathematically precise definitions.
The goal is a complete description of the mathematical models
underlying LingPipe.  To understand these sections will require a
stronger background in algorithms and statistical modeling than
the other sections of the book.
        


\mysection{The Java Programming Language}

\noindent
We chose Java as the basis for LingPipe because we felt it provided
the best tradeoff among efficiency, usability, portability, and
library availability.

The presentation here assumes the reader has a basic working knowledge
of the Java programming language.  We will focus on a few aspects of
Java that are particularly crucial for processing textual language
data, such as character and string representations, input and output
streams and character encodings, regular expressions, parsing HTML and
XML markup, etc.  In explaining LingPipe's design, we will also delve
into greater detail on general features of Java such as concurrency,
generics, floating point representations, and the collection package.

\mysubsection{Java Standard Edition 6}

\noindent
This book is based on the latest currently supported standard edition
of the Java platform (Java SE), which is version 6.  You will need the
Java development kit (JDK) in order to compile Java programs.  A java
virtual machine (JVM) is required to execute compiled Java programs.
A Java runtime environment (JRE) contains platform-specific support
and integration for a JVM and often interfaces to web browsers for
applet support.

Information on installing Java is available in Appendix~\ref{appendix:installation}.


\mysection{Shell and Apache Ant Build Tool}

\noindent
We primarily work in the shell with a text editor. Instructions for
installing shells for Windows are availabe in Appendix~\ref{appendix:installation}.

though it's
possible to do everything in an integrated development environment for
Java like Eclipse or NetBeans.

We present examples for compilation and for running programs using the
Apache Ant build tool.  This is an XML-based tool for scripting builds
and other operations that's simpler than dependency-based tools such
as the classic Unix make program or Apache's Maven.
