\chapter{Getting Started}

\firstchar{T}his book is intended to provide two things.  First and
foremost, it presents a hands-on introduction to the use of the
LingPipe natural language processing library for building natural
language processing components and applications.  Our main focus is on
programming with the LingPipe library.  Second, the book contains
precise mathematical definitions of all of the models and substantial
algorithms underlying LingPipe.  Understanding the finer mathematical
points will not be assumed for the practical sections of the book.  Of
course, it's impossible to fully sidestep mathematics while explaining
what is essentially a collection of algorithms implementing mathematical
models of language.
