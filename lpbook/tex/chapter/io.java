\chapter{Input and Output}\label{chap:io}

\firstchar{J}ava provides a rich array of classes and interfaces to
deal with inputting and outputting data.  Data in this context
consists of a stream of bytes. These bytes may encode anything, but
we are particularly interested in the case of natural language text
data, with or without document structure.  To support streams of
\code{char} values, Java provides character stream interfaces
and implementations as well as byte streams.  

In this chapter, we consider Java byte streams and
character streams as well as identifiers for local content in
the form of files and arbitrary content in the form of URLs.  We
will also consider reading to or from arrays, and 
the use of compression.
