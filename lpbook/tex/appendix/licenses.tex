1. This Alias-i Royalty Free License Version 1 ("License") governs the
copying, modifying, and distributing of the computer program or work
containing a notice stating that it is subject to the terms of this
License and any derivative works of that computer program or work.
The computer program or work and any derivative works thereof are the
"Software." Your copying, modifying, or distributing of the Software
constitutes acceptance of this License.  Although you are not required
to accept this License, since you have not signed it, nothing else
grants you permission to copy, modify, or distribute the Software.  If
you wish to receive a license from Alias-i under different terms than
those contained in this License, please contact Alias-i.  Otherwise,
if you do not accept this License, any copying, modifying, or
distributing of the Software is strictly prohibited by law.

2. You may copy or modify the Software or use any output of the
Software (i) for internal non-production trial, testing and evaluation
of the Software, or (ii) in connection with any product or service you
provide to third parties for free.  Copying or modifying the Software
includes the acts of "installing", "running", "using", "accessing" or
"deploying" the Software as those terms are understood in the software
industry.  Therefore, those activities are only permitted under this
License in the ways that copying or modifying are permitted.

computer program that is not the Software, but that (a) is distributed
in connection with the Software or contains any part of the Software,
(b) causes the Software to be copied or modified (i.e., ran, used, or
executed), such as through an API call, or (c) uses any output of the
Software, then you must distribute that other computer program under a
license defined as a Free Software License by the Free Software
Foundation or an Approved Open Source License by the Open Source
Initiative.
\\[8pt]
5. You may not copy, modify, or distribute the Software except as
expressly provided under this License, unless you receive a different
written license from Alias-i to do so.  Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, or distribute the Software is without Alias-i's permission, is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
Your rights under this License may only be reinstated by a signed
writing from Alias-i.

   exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under this limited
   warranty will be at Sun's option to replace Software media or
   refund the fee paid for Software. Any implied warranties on the
   Software are limited to 90 days. Some states do not allow

   OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF
   LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO
   USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
   SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's liability to you, whether in

with the terms of this License, and acknowledging their
work-made-for-hire status or assigning exclusive right to the work
product and associated Intellectual Property Rights to You.

3.  Requirements and Responsibilities.

3.1.  Research Use License.  As a condition of exercising the rights
granted under Section 2.1 a) above, You agree to comply with the
following:

a) Your Contribution to the Community.  All Error Corrections and
Shared Modifications which You create or contribute to are
automatically subject to the licenses granted under Section 2.2 above.
You are encouraged to license all of Your other Modifications under
Section 2.2 as Shared Modifications, but are not required to do so.
You agree to notify Original Contributor of any errors in the
Specification.

b) Source Code Availability.  You agree to provide all Your Error
Corrections to Original Contributor as soon as reasonably practicable
and, in any event, prior to Internal Deployment Use or Commercial Use,
if applicable.  Original Contributor may, at its discretion, post
Source Code for Your Error Corrections and Shared Modifications on the
Community Webserver.  You may also post Error Corrections and Shared
Modifications on a web-server of Your choice; provided, that You must
take reasonable precautions to ensure that only Licensees have access
to such Error Corrections and Shared Modifications.  Such precautions
shall include, without limitation, a password protection scheme
limited to Licensees and a click-on, download certification of
Licensee status required of those attempting to download from the
server.  An example of an acceptable certification is attached as
Attachment A-2.

c) Notices.  All Error Corrections and Shared Modifications You create
or contribute to must include a file documenting the additions and
changes You made and the date of such additions and changes.  You must
also include the notice set forth in Attachment A-1 in the file
header.  If it is not possible to put the notice in a particular
Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include the
notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file), where a
recipient would be most likely to look for such a notice.

d) Redistribution.

(i) Source.  Covered Code may be distributed in Source Code form only
to another Licensee (except for students as provided below).  You may
not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Code that alter the
rights, requirements, or responsibilities of such Licensee.  You may
distribute Covered Code to students for use in connection with their
course work and research projects undertaken at accredited educational
institutions.  Such students need not be Licensees, but must be given
a copy of the notice set forth in Attachment A-3 and such notice must
also be included in a file header or prominent location in the Source
Code made available to such students.

(ii) Executable.  You may distribute Executable version(s) of Covered
Code to Licensees and other third parties only for the purpose of
evaluation and comment in connection with Research Use by You and
under a license of Your choice, but which limits use of such
Executable version(s) of Covered Code only to that purpose.

(iii) Modified Class, Interface and Package Naming. In connection with
Research Use by You only, You may use Original Contributor's class,
interface and package names only to accurately reference or invoke the
Source Code files You modify.  Original Contributor grants to You a
limited license to the extent necessary for such purposes.

(iv) Modifications.  You expressly agree that any distribution, in
whole or in part, of Modifications developed by You shall only be done
pursuant to the term and conditions of this License.

e) Extensions.

(i) Covered Code.  You may not include any Source Code of Community
Code in any Extensions;

(ii) Publication.  No later than the date on which You first
distribute such Extension for Commercial Use, You must publish to the
industry, on a non-confidential basis and free of all copyright
restrictions with respect to reproduction and use, an accurate and
current specification for any Extension.  In addition, You must make
available an appropriate test suite, pursuant to the same rights as
the specification, sufficiently detailed to allow any third party
reasonably skilled in the technology to produce implementations of the
Extension compatible with the specification.  Such test suites must be
made available as soon as reasonably practicable but, in no event,
later than ninety (90) days after Your first Commercial Use of the
Extension.  You must use reasonable efforts to promptly clarify and
correct the specification and the test suite upon written request by
Original Contributor.

(iii) Open.  You agree to refrain from enforcing any Intellectual
Property Rights You may have covering any interface(s) of Your
Extension, which would prevent the implementation of such interface(s)
by Original Contributor or any Licensee.  This obligation does not
prevent You from enforcing any Intellectual Property Right You have
that would otherwise be infringed by an implementation of Your
Extension.

(iv) Class, Interface and Package Naming.  You may not add any
packages, or any public or protected classes or interfaces with names
that originate or might appear to originate from Original Contributor
including, without limitation, package or class names which begin with
"sun", "java", "javax", "jini", "net.jini", "com.sun" or their
equivalents in any subsequent class, interface and/or package naming
convention adopted by Original Contributor.  It is specifically
suggested that You name any new packages using the "Unique Package
Naming Convention" as described in "The Java Language Specification"
by James Gosling, Bill Joy, and Guy Steele, ISBN 0-201-63451-1, August
1996.  Section 7.7 "Unique Package Names", on page 125 of this
specification which states, in part:

"You form a unique package name by first having (or belonging to an
organization that has) an Internet domain name, such as "sun.com".
You then reverse the name, component by component, to obtain, in this
example, "Com.sun", and use this as a prefix for Your package names,
using a convention developed within Your organization to further
administer package names."

3.2.  Additional Requirements and Responsibilities.  Any additional
requirements and responsibilities relating to the Technology are
listed in Attachment F (Additional Requirements and Responsibilities),
if applicable, and are hereby incorporated into this Section 3.

4.  Versions of the License.

4.1.  License Versions.  Original Contributor may publish revised
versions of the License from time to time.  Each version will be given
a distinguishing version number.

4.2.  Effect.  Once a particular version of Covered Code has been
provided under a version of the License, You may always continue to
use such Covered Code under the terms of that version of the License.

the third party test facility if applicable, Your test results that
demonstrate that Covered Code is Compliant Covered Code and that
Original Contributor may publish or otherwise distribute such test
results.

Common Public License - v 1.0
\\[4pt]
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
\\[4pt]
1. DEFINITIONS
\\[4pt]
"Contribution" means:
\\[4pt]
      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
      documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
\\[4pt]
      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
\\[4pt]
      i) changes to the Program, and
\\[4pt]
      ii) additions to the Program;
\\[4pt]
      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate
      from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A
      Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to
      the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
      Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
      the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software
      distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own
      license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the
      Program.
\\[4pt]
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
\\[4pt]
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
alone or when combined with the Program.
\\[4pt]
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
\\[4pt]
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
Agreement, including all Contributors.
\\[4pt]
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
\\[4pt]
      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
      hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense
      the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
      derivative works, in source code and object code form.
\\[4pt]
      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
      hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
      patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer
      to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
      Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This
      patent license shall apply to the combination of the
      Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is
      added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution
      causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed
      Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se
      is licensed hereunder.
\\[4pt]
      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants
      the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no
      assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does
      not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of
      any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
      Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on
      infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a
      condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted
      hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
      secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if
      any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to
      allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's
      responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the
      Program.
\\[4pt]
      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to
      grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
\\[4pt]
3. REQUIREMENTS
\\[4pt]
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
under its own license agreement, provided that:
\\[4pt]
      a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;
      and
\\[4pt]
      b) its license agreement:
\\[4pt]
      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
      warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
      warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
      implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
      for a particular purpose;
\\[4pt]
      ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
      liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
      incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
\\[4pt]
      iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
      are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other
      party; and
\\[4pt]
      iv) states that source code for the Program is available from
      such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
      reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
      software exchange.
\\[4pt]
When the Program is made available in source code form:
\\[4pt]
      a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and 
\\[4pt]
      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
      the Program.
\\[4pt]
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
within the Program.
\\[4pt]
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
\\[4pt]
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
\\[4pt]
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)
promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,
and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with
the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
claim at its own expense.
\\[4pt]
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
must pay those damages.
\\[4pt]
5. NO WARRANTY
\\[4pt]
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
unavailability or interruption of operations.
\\[4pt]
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
\\[4pt]
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
\\[4pt]
7. GENERAL
\\[4pt]
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
\\[4pt]
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as
of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient
institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.
\\[4pt]
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably
practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and
any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
continue and survive.
\\[4pt]
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial
Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the
Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to
the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may
elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under
the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual
property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly,
by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
\\[4pt]
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement
more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives
its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.
