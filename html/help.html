<a name="task"><h2>Annotation Task</h2></a>
Annotate medline citations
with a list of EntrezGene or Homologe database ids
of genes mentioned in that abstract.
<p>
The text mention must be about a specific gene; 
therefore mentions of gene families and protien domains are excluded.
Because of the ambiguity between genes and proteins, 
we use a generous annotation standard, so that
statements about specific proteins, antibodies,
and gene receptors count as mentions of genes.
<p>
<a name="ui"><h2>Annotation Tool Interface</h2></a>
<p>
<h3>Article annotations</h3>
<p>
To annotate an article
enter the list of comma separated gene ids into the field marked "Genes" at the top of the page
and click on the button marked "Record."
For example, to annotate an article which mentions human gene PTEN enter the EntrezGene GeneID "5728"
into the "Genes" field.
<p>
In order to distinguish a HomoloGeneID from an EntrezGene GeneID, prefix the HomoloGeneID
with the text: "hg" followed by a colon followed by the HomoloGeneID.
For example, to annotate an article abstract which mentions the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor
but which is ambiguous as to the organism, use the HomoloGeneID: "hg:68073".
<p>
If the article contains no specific gene mentions, click on the button marked "No Genes".
<p>
<h3>Revising previously annotated articles</h3>
<p>
Revision of an article will replace existing annotations with the new annotation.
<p>
<a name="guidelines"><h2>Annotation Guidelines</h2></a>
<ul>
<li>Specific protein mentions are annotated with the ids of their eponymous gene.
<li>Mentions of antibodies to and receptors of proteins are annotated with the ids of genes for
those proteins and receptors.
<li>Mentions of a gene variant - polymorphism, mutation - are annotated with the gene id.
<li>Mentions of a sub-regions within a gene - including promoter, upstream, downstream regions - are annotated with the gene id.
<li>Domains are not annotated as genes.
<li>Mentions of a gene family or protein family are not annotated.
<li>Mentions of disease or phenotype are not annotated.
<li>If the EntrezGene database contains multiple entries for a gene, all applicable entries are listed.
<li>Species information, if not explicitly mentioned, may be inferred either from context, or other 
knowledge about the citation.

</ul>

in the region 15q11-13.
Because &quot;SNURF-SNRPN&quot; is listed as a possible alternate name for SNRPN (6638),
and since SNURF (8926) lies within the span of SNRPN (6638),
the better annotation is SNRPN (6638).
