SYSTEM: Jakarta Lucene 1.3 (jakarta.apache.org/lucene)

LINGUISTICS: Alias-i LingPipe (www.aliasi.com/lingpipe)

INDEXING: Tokenized with LingPipe IndoEuropeanTokenizer, lowercased,
without a stop list.  Combined document text into single field with
boosts: 4*title, 1*abstract, 2*ordinary MESH, 4*starred MESH,
1*chemical names.  Took 5 hours, producing 9GB index, including
storing original titles, abstracts, MESH terms and chemical names.

SEARCH: Tokenized with LingPipe IndoEuropeanTokenizer, lowercased,
removed stop terms.  Used fields with boosts: 4*title, 2*need,
1*context.  Lucene's standard TF/IDF implementation: TF is square root
of raw frequency; IDF is log(num docs/doc freq + 1) + 1; doc and query
normalized to unit length.  Took 15 minutes per result set of 50
topics with 1000 results/topic.

TERMS: Added all terms recognized by LingPipe's GENIA-corpus trained
Genomics named entity annotator as quoted search terms with a boost of
4 (multiplied by field boost).
