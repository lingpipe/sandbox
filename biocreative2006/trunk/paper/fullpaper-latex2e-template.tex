\section{Introduction}

The page limit for full paper is TEN.  In case the number
of pages still exceeds this limit after your efforts, please contact
giw2004@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp for advice.

Do not change the text width, text height, baseline, font size, etc.,
specified in LaTeX2e/LaTeX/MS Word templates.

\section{Method and Results}

Of course you can create more sections with any section titles.

\subsection{Tables}

Table~\ref{table:sample} is an example of a table.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Bioinformatics conferences in 2003.}
\label{table:sample}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll} \hline
Conference  & Date          & Site \\ \hline
RECOMB      & April 2-5     & Venice \\
ISMB        & August 6-10   & Fortaleza \\
GIW         & December 18-20& Yokohama \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Figures}

When you use figures (Fig.~\ref{figure:sample}, Fig.~\ref{figure:color})
with a special style file, please provide it.

Printed version of ``Genome Informatics Vol. 17, No. 2'' is
monochromatic and has a page limit. But, the electronic version (PDF,
HTML) does not have such restrictions. Therefore, we encourage the
author(s) to send any hypermedia files which can be attached to your
paper. The electronic version will be also published at JSBi Home Page
(\url{http://www.jsbi.org/jsbi_new/gioinfo.html}).

\subsection{Citation and References}

Reference style and citation should strictly follow this
template~\cite{akutsu98,doi99,motowani94,sw81,JSBi}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item References should be arranged in the alphabetical order of
authors and all references SHOULD be cited.
\item  Style (see examples in {\bf References} below).
\begin{enumerate}
\item Journal: author(s), title, journal name,
vol(issue):startpage-endpage, year.
\item Proceedigns: author(s), title, Proc. conference name, publisher
(if possible), startpage-endpage, year.
\item  Book: author(s), title, publisher, year.
\item  Other: author(s), title, any helpful information, year.
\item  URL: \url{http://(URL site)}.  URLs should be listed in the last.
\end{enumerate}
\item Provide all author names.  If the number of authors is
too large, you may reduce appropriately (such as
Venter, J.C., Adams, M.D., Myers, E.W., Li, P.W., {\em et al.},
The sequence of the human genome,
{\em Science}, 291(5507):1304--1351, 2001.)
\end{enumerate}
