System Description Questions

RUN1

- How would you summarize your overall approach?
A two-stage model.  First stage is N-best using an HMM based on 
character language models.  Second stage is longer-distance
character language model based.

- Did you use additional training data in addition to the provided one?
No.

- Did  you use machine learning (ML)  approaches? 
Y

--- In case you used ML techniques, which ones did you use ? (Just short 
method names)
See above.

- Did you use NLP technique components (e.g. POS tagging, stemming, 
 parsing)? 
No.

- Did you use Bio-NLP components (i.e. NLP tools adapted to the 
biomedical literature, such as MedPost)? 
No.

- Did you use external lexical resources, such as dictionaries or 
ontologies? (Y/N)
No.

- Did you use regular expression or pattern matching strategies? (Y/N)
No.


RUN2 and RUN3

- How would you summarize your overall approach?
Ran the first stage HMM model, returning all entities with
conditional probabilities above a threshold (implemented using
forward-backward).  The first best found 7593 mentions.

RUN2
Threshold=0.9.  Expect high precision with around 20% of
the recall of the first-best.  Found 1581 mentions.

RUN3
Threshold=0.001 Expect high recall with around 20% of the
precision of the first-best results.  Found 37,303 mentions.
