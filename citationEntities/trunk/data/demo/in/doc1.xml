<chunk type="title">UK 'was right to expel Russians'</chunk>

<chunk type="p"> Prime Minister Gordon Brown has said the UK will make
&quot;no apologies&quot; for expelling four Russian diplomats.</chunk>

<chunk type="p"> The decision follows Moscow's refusal to hand over
the former KGB agent accused of murdering Alexander Litvinenko in
London last year.</chunk>

<chunk type="p"> Mr Brown said that because &quot;there is no
forthcoming co-operation, then action has to be taken&quot;.</chunk>

<chunk type="p"> The Kremlin said the decision was &quot;immoral&quot;
and warned of &quot;serious consequences&quot; for the UK.</chunk>
