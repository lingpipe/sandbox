LingBlast is an app which links Entrez-Gene identifiers 
to Entrez-Pubmed identifiers with confidence scores.
</P>
<P>
The idea behind this app is based on an analogy to BLAST:
Altschul et al.'s Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, which finds
homologous (approximately matching) genes or proteins given a set of
samples to match.  LingBlast finds homologous gene or protein names
(mentions) in text given a set of samples (aliases) to match.
The confidence score is based on how well the gene's surrounding context 
matches that of the known references for that gene.
